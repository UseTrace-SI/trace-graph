# trace-graph

Code map for Trace: analyzes a repository and maps files, symbols, and relationships.

## Commands
- `trace-graph version`
- `trace-graph analyze [--repo .]`
- `trace-graph symbols`
- `trace-graph query <term>`

## Build
`go build ./...`

## Index integrity

Reindexing replaces changed files and removes deleted files, symbols, call relationships, and search entries in one transaction. A failed scan or database write leaves the previous generation intact. Cache keys and symbol IDs include the canonical repository identity; content hashes detect edits even when file size and timestamps are unchanged. Switching between default and Tree-sitter builds invalidates the cache.

The old derived index is cleared once on schema upgrade. Run `trace-graph analyze` again to rebuild it. This does not change source files.

Validation: `go test -race ./...`, `go test -race -tags treesitter ./...`, and either command with `-count=100`. Tree-sitter requires a C toolchain.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs pure Go builds, vet, race tests, and 100 repetitions of the regression cases on GitHub-hosted macOS and Linux runners for pushes, pull requests, and manual runs. The workflow has read-only repository access. Hosted execution begins after these changes are pushed.
Tree-sitter vet, race tests, and 100-run regressions are also included.
